### Some note about LAB1:
- At first, when i see the topics of LAB1, i think it's too difficult for me because i don't know where i should start.
- So luckily, finally, i completed it but i still think it's too difficult for me.
- I hope the next LAB not too difficult like this LAB.

### Problem 1:
- Firstly, i don't know how to solve it.
- After many days of finding solutions and got suggest by the teacher, so finally, i found the way to solve it
- Mostly, the problem 1 has been implemented by the teacher at class time.
- So i solved it.

### Problem 2:
- I don't know how to should start either.
- And I found a way to solve it somewhere on the internet.
- Fortunately, that solution helped me solve this problem.
- But i think my program still not working very well.
- Lastly, i hope that my program can run exactly :v

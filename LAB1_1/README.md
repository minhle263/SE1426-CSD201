Hello, this is some notes for project and highlights of project  
-Problem 1:
+At first, I don't know where I should start, then teacher suggest use DoublyLinkedList and PriorityQueue to do. Thanks God, I see the way 
+The hardest part is add Player into Sorted queue. I updated this add() method a lot 
+Hmmmm, this problem I don't need to think too much, cause over half of this problem is implemented by teacher already
-Prolem 2:
+First I think about the HTML Parse method in book, and it's very useful
+But I stuck with unpaired tag and I'm stress about it =)))))
+Then, finally I solved it
+Then, I found out that <script> tags have some problem, so I treat it special(of course it's hardcode)(I can't import picture here, if you
want to see what problem is, then send mail for me).
+Hmmm, I don't know it's perfect or not, but interesting 
-Yaaa, solve these problems then again stuck with CLI, cause this is first time I use it(then solved)
-Lastly, I create file jar and it's a little bit not follow my expectation, so I delete some file, then my file is broken(it can't load main class and I found anyways to 
solve it, but I can't T__T). So, I have to write again all file(just copy and paste). I hope that my teacher not fail me because of it.
-Hope that my file can run exactly :v
-Hmmmmmm, I have to say, this lab1 makes me stress so much(cause not only this course have deadline). But I solved it, so I can let me rest a little bit :v
